## Testing Flow

For a complete experience, follow these steps:

1. Start at **Station 1** where you'll begin your journey and interact with the narrative
2. After completing your journey at Station 1, you'll receive a codename
3. Go to **Station 2** and use your codename to continue your unique story path

## Important Testing Notes

- Please test both stations in sequence (Station 1 → Station 2)
- Take notes on any issues or feedback you have during your experience
