                 |___| |___|

that is (supposed to be, anyway) the Chinese letter/word that is 
exclusively used to denote "a wedding event".
This word is actually composed of a more general word, namely 
                 ___|___
                  __|__ 
                  .---.     
                  |___|        
                 __\_/__    
                  __X__      
                 |     | 
                 |_____|

which means "happy" or "happiness", and by concatenating two copies of this 
above word, you get that special word about wedding. In fact, if you go to any
chinese restaurant, pretty often you can see this word, made into 3-D and 
painted in golden, hanging on the wall near the dragons.
